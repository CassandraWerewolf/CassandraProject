Crazy 9-Player Ruleset 

[b]Good Roles:[/b]

[u]Seer[/u] - Each night receives a vision of a target player as 'wolf' or 'not wolf.' The seer chooses a vision each night including N0.

[u]Priest[/u] - Each night receives a vision of the lynched player. The vision tells the priest that player's alignment (good or evil). The priest recieves this vision at dawn.

[u]Aux Seer[/u] - Each night receives a vision of a target player as 'evil' or 'not evil'.  Will recieve 'evil' when viewing the traitor or cultist, and will recieve 'not evil' when viewing any other player including the wolves.  The aux seer chooses a vision each night including N0.

[u]Bodyguard[/u] - Each night choose a player to protect.  If the wolves
target that player the bodyguard will die instead.

[u]White Hat[/u] - When he dies (lynch or night kill) his role will be
revealed to all.

[b]Evil Roles:[/b]

[u]2 Werewolves[/u] - The werewolves know each other's identity, and may private message/chat without restriction. Each night the wolves choose one target player to kill. There is no kill on Night 0.

[u]Traitor[/u] - Starts the game knowing the identity of the seer and aux seer.  The traitor wins if the wolves win, but does not count as a werewolf for parity
purposes (see below).

[u]Cultist[/u] - Starts the game knowing the identity of the wolves.  The
cultist wins if the wolves win, but does not count as a werewolf for parity
purposes (see below).


[b]Victory Conditions:[/b]

[u]Good[/u] - All good players win if all werewolves are eliminated. The traitor and cultist do not have to be eliminated in order for Good to win.

[u]Evil[/u] - All evil players win if the wolves achieve parity: if at any time the number of wolves remaining equals the number of non-wolves remaining (including the traitor and cultist), evil wins. The traitor and cultist counts as a 'non-wolf' for these purposes.


[b]Lynch Rules:[/b]

Each day players vote for one player to be lynched. The player receiving the most votes is killed. If there is a tie between two or more players, the tied player with the  <tiebreaker> is killed.

Lynch time is  <lynch> BGG time. Votes cast with this time-stamp are counted. Votes cast after this time are invalid. Votes made during the night phase are invalid.

All votes must conform to the Cassandra Vote Tally System rules. (Will be
posted once the game starts). If all living players vote night fall it will
speed up the dusk.

Neither the player's role or team is revealed upon lynch, except for the White
Hat role.


[b]Night Orders:[/b]

Wolves, Seer, Sorcerer and Bodyguard must all submit their night orders by <night> BGG time. They do this by using the Cassandra Game Order system in the Cassandra Chat System.

The wolves' night kill choice is revealed with the DAWN post. The players' role and team are not revealed unless it is the White Hat. 

If all living players (including those with out night actions) click on the
'Lock Game Actions' button it will speed up Dawn.
