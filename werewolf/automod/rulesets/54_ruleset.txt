[b]Victory Conditions[/b]

Good wins by killing the werewolf, wolf cub, possessed villager, and evil priest.
Evil wins if the wolf, wolf cub, possed villager, and evil priest achieve parity.


Standard bgg werewolf rules apply otherwise. I'm sure you can look them up somewhere if you don't know them.

I'm pretty sure that cassy will attach something to this that will tell you lynch times and whatnot, but just in case:

Lynchtime: <lynch>
Night Orders deadline: <night>
Tiebreaker: <tiebreaker>

That should do it. Did I forget anything?
