[COLOR=#CC9933]                                 [b][size=18]~ NO MERCY! ~[/size][/b][/COLOR]


[COLOR=#003399][b]This village is not your regular peasant hole with some defenseless townspeople who are waiting to be slaughtered until their visionary finally gets lucky and tells them who the wolves are. 

No! These guys are capable! 

The visionary is not some backwater monastery reject, but a full seer who can look into the soul of his fellow townspeople and see them for what they are exactly...and he's currently training a talented pupil in the arts of his craft.
There are also strong armsmen in town who will fight to the death and are capable of mortally wounding their opponents.

'Good for them!' you'd think.

Yes! But it was born of need, because the wolves in this town have managed to breed a cub who has been so hidden that he managed to train as a priest for years, greatly enhancing the knowledge that the beasts possess.
And if that wasn't enough, recently a second visionary has moved into the village. This one however has far darker intentions than the other one, though he's just as capable as his counterpart.
Finally, word on the street is that not all the armsmen can be fully trusted in this village.

Mass conflict is waiting to happen with so many strong characters. The wolves and their allies smell blood and mercy shall not be granted.[/b][/COLOR]
