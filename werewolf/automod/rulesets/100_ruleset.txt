Dusk is at <lynch> BGG time. Votes cast with this time-stamp are counted. Votes cast after this time are invalid. Votes made during the night phase are invalid.

All votes must conform to the Cassandra Vote Tally System rules. (Will be posted once the game starts). If all living players vote nightfall it will speed up dusk.

Dawn is at <night> BGG time. All night actions must be submitted in the Cassandra Chat System before this time.

If all living players (including those without night actions) click on the 'Lock Game Actions' button it will speed up Dawn.
