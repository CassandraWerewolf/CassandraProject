g{[b][size=18]The Summoning of the Wolf[/size][/b]}g


b{This small village has peacefully existed for as long as its residents can remember, nestled almost as nature would have it between a  deep calm river and towering cliffs of craggy rock.  The cliffs have long been explored and forgotten, but something has been missed.  A relic of great importance that still has a life of its past.  Long ago, this village was conquered by a band of evil werewolves and their servants, until a band of wandering humans overtook them, better equipped to know the difference between human and dog.  But as time wore on, people, distracted by other things and quick to call things fantasy, seemed to forget.

Now, with werewolves now only a fantasy everywhere, their legacy has only been preserved by various wandering bands of cultists who can only search for the old evil magicks to reclaim the dominance of old.  Such  a group has settled in this village, blending in with the others.  They have waited.  They have searched.  And they have worked.  Now, two of them have culminated their work and have summoned a great werewolf of old to kill villagers once again and conquer the village and take it for its own.  The cultists, however, may have underestimated this village.  For perhaps they have not completely forgotten the past.  In addition, the work of these cultists may not have gone completely unnoticed by a  certain old man of the village who believes the legends and knows what the future may contain.  }b
