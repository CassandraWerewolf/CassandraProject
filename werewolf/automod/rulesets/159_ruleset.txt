[size=12]Valley of the Perfect Seers[/size]

b{Of all the many small villages that exist in the hypothetical world we play werewolf in, those that exist in valleys have a long tradition of being outposts for seers, where seers can gather for rest, recuperation, and to hang out with other seers and discuss that latest wolf finding techniques. This valley village is no different. Here, though, only the best of the best seers come. No one is quite sure why. Some say   that the mystic wall that surrounds the town can only be breached by the most experienced of mages. Others say that the nature of the town brings to strong to it and repulses the weak. Still others say that Redhawke did this writeup, and that's how he decided it would be. 

As is to be expected from a town existing in the werewolf universe, peace was not for long. A band a werewolves, summoned by an estranged mage, invaded the town. The power of the seers is great, but will the might of the werewolves prove greater still?}b
