[u]Sorcerer[/u] - The sorcerer knows the identity of the werewolves and wins with them, even if dead. Each night, he may view a player to see if they are the seer or not. He gets a random negative N0 view. 

[b]Victory Conditions:[/b]

[u]Good[/u] - All good players win if all werewolves are eliminated, or if the last two players remaining are the hunter and one werewolf. 

[u]Evil[/u] - All evil players win if the wolves and wolf cubs achieve parity: if at any time the number of wolves and wolf cubs remaining equals the number of non-wolves remaining, evil wins. Howver, if one wolf is left with the hunter, then good wins. 


[b]Lynch Rules:[/b]

Each day players vote for one player to be lynched. The player receiving the most votes is killed. If there is a tie between two or more players, the tied player with the longest held last vote is killed.

Lynch time is <lynch> BGG time. Votes cast with this time-stamp are counted. Votes cast after this time are invalid. Votes made during the night phase are invalid.

All votes must conform to the Cassandra Vote Tally System rules. (Will be
posted once the game starts). If all living players vote night fall it will
speed up the dusk. If there is a tie in the lynch votes, it will be broken by <tiebreaker>

Roles will be revealed on death. 


[b]Night Orders:[/b]

Wolves, Seer, Bodygaurd, and Sorcerer must all submit their night orders by <night> BGG time. They do this by using the Cassandra Game Order system in the Cassandra Chat System.

The wolves' night kill choice is revealed with the DAWN post. If the player is a wolf or wolf cub they will be revealed as Lupis Family upon death. The Seer will be revealed as seer upon death. The Hunter and villagers will be revealed as villager upon death.

If all living players (including those with out night actions) click on the
'Lock Game Actions' button it will speed up Dawn.
