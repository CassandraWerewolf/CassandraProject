All Reveal 7 player ruleset
[size=3]Disclaimer: I have little experience designing all-reveal style templates. -redhawke[/size]

[b]Good roles[/b]

[u]Seer[/u]- views a player each night, including N0, to see if they are a wolf or not. 

[u]Hunter[/u]- good wins if he is left alone with a wolf.

[u]Priest[/u]- views a dead player each night to determine thier role.

[u]Bodyguard[/u]- targets a player each night, if they are targeted for a kill he is killed instead.

[b]Evil Roles[/b]

[u]Werewolf[/u]- Kills a player each night.

[u]Cultist[/u]- knows the ID of the wolf.

[u]Sorcerer[/u]- views a player each night, including N0, to see if they are a seer or not.  

(please note that this means that unless an evil dies D1 or N1, evil will likely win)

[b]Victory Conditions:[/b]

[u]Good[/u] - All good players win if the werewolf is eliminated, or left alone with the hunter. 

[u]Evil[/u] - All evil players win if the wolf achieves parity. 


[b]Lynch Rules:[/b]

Each day players vote for one player to be lynched. The player receiving the most votes is killed. If there is a tie between two or more players, the tied player with the <tiebreaker> is killed.

Lynch time is <lynch> BGG time. Votes cast with this time-stamp are counted. Votes cast after this time are invalid. Votes made during the night phase are invalid.

All votes must conform to the Cassandra Vote Tally System rules. (Will be
posted once the game starts). If all living players vote night fall it will
speed up the dusk.

Roles will not be revealed on death.

[b]Night Orders:[/b]

Wolf, sorcerer, bodyguard, priest, and Seer must all submit their night orders by <night> BGG time. They do this by using the Cassandra Game Order system in the Cassandra Chat System.

The wolves' night kill choice is revealed with the DAWN post. 

If all living players (including those with out night actions) click on the
'Lock Game Actions' button it will speed up Dawn.
