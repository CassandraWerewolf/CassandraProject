Basic 9-Player Ruleset

[b]Good Roles:[/b]

[u]Seer[/u] - Each night receives a vision of a target player as 'wolf' or 'not wolf.' The seer receives a vision on Night 0 of one randomly chosen player that is 'not wolf.' Thereafter, the seer chooses which player to view.

[u]Priest[/u] - Each night receives a vision of a target deceased player. The vision tells the priest that deceased player's exact role. The priest does not receive any vision on Night 0. Thereafter, the priest chooses one deceased player to view.

[u]Hunter[/u] - If only two players remain in the game and the hunter is one of those players, then the good team wins even if the other player is a werewolf.

[u]3 Villagers[/u] - Ordinary villagers with no special powers.


[b]Evil Roles:[/b]

[u]2 Werewolves[/u] - The werewolves know each other's identity, and may private message/chat without restriction. Each night the wolves choose one target player to kill. There is no kill on Night 0.

[u]Sorcerer[/u] - Each night receives a vision of a target player as 'seer' or 'not seer.' The sorcerer receives a vision on Night 0 of one randomly chosen player that is 'not seer.' Thereafter, the sorcerer chooses which player to view. The sorcerer wins if the wolves win, but does not count as a werewolf for parity purposes (see below).


[b]Victory Conditions:[/b]

[u]Good[/u] - All good players win if all werewolves are eliminated, or if the last two players remaining are the hunter and one werewolf. The sorcerer does not have to be eliminated in order for Good to win.

[u]Evil[/u] - All evil players win if the wolves achieve parity: if at any time the number of wolves remaining equals the number of non-wolves remaining (including the sorcerer), evil wins. Howver, if one wolf is left with the hunter, then good wins. The sorcerer counts as a 'non-wolf' for these purposes.


[b]Day Rules:[/b]

Each day players vote for one player to be killed. The player receiving the most votes is killed. If there is a tie between two or more players, the tied player with the <tiebreaker> is killed.

Dusk time is <lynch> BGG time. Votes cast with this time-stamp are counted. Votes cast after this time are invalid. Votes made during the night phase are invalid.

All votes must conform to the Cassandra Vote Tally System rules. (Will be
posted once the game starts). If all living players vote night fall it will
speed up the dusk.

Neither the player's role or team is revealed upon death.


[b]Night Orders:[/b]

Wolves, Seer, Sorcerer, and Priest must all submit their night orders by <night> BGG time. They do this by using the Cassandra Game Order system in the Cassandra Chat System.

The wolves' night kill choice is revealed with the DAWN post. The players' role and team are not revealed. 

If all living players (including those with out night actions) click on the
'Lock Game Actions' button it will speed up Dawn.
