[COLOR=#003399][b]11 (eleven) is the natural number following 10 and preceding 12. It is the first number which cannot be represented by a human counting his or her eight fingers and two thumbs additively (although it can be represented in a variety of other ways using human bodily parts, such as counting additively with the twenty digits including the toes, using the thumb to count the finger phalanges of one hand additively up to twelve, or using the fingers in one hand to count up to fifteen binarily). Eleven is the smallest positive integer requiring three syllables in English, and it is also the largest prime number with a single-morpheme name in this language.[/b][/COLOR]
