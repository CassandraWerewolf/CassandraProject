[COLOR=#bb8800][c]          [/c][b][size=18]~ ALTERNATIVE 9-PLAYER ~[/size][/b][/COLOR]


[COLOR=#7722bb][b]After lots of lycanthrope infestations in recent years the people of this village have employed two seers. Their identity is unknown. One is specialized in rooting out the bigger werewolves, while the other one has dedicated his life to the extermination of the younger, more sneaky, wolf cubs. Every day, one of them reports his findings to a spokesman, who then informs the villagers.
All went well for a while and the villagers were able to lynch all the wolves before they became a huge threat. But because of that, the local gravedigger saw his livelihood in great danger with people no longer dying in the night and he decided to betray the village. He became a spy for the werewolves and now works with them to find out out who the secret seers are.
Can you stop the Traitor and his wolves from taking over the village?[/b][/COLOR]
