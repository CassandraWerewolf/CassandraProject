[b]Good Roles (called evil in the flavour though):[/b]

[u]Seer[/u] - Each night receives a vision of a target player as 'good' (cannibals) or 'evil' (the man, the boy and friends). The seer receives a vision on Night 0 of one randomly chosen player that is 'good.' Thereafter, the seer chooses which player to view. 

[u]Gang leader (Hunter)[/u] - If only two players remain in the game and the leader is one of those players, then the good team wins even if the other player is a werewolf. The leader is tough and will survive 1 death of any sort. 


[u]Bodyguard[/u] - The Bodyguard protects 1 player each night. If they are targeted for a kill, the bodyguard will die in their place. When lynched or killed, the bodyguard can take someone else out with him.

[u]Baby roaster (Priest)[/u] - Has a chat with the Roaster. Learns the exact roles of the recently departed each night.  

[u]Roaster (Mason)[/u] This fetus-loving cannibal is a close friend of the Baby Roaster.  They have a chat together.

[u]4 Cannibals (Villagers)[/u] - Ordinary cannibals with no special powers. 


[b]Evil Roles (called 'Good' in the flavour though):[/b]

[u]The man (Werewolf)[/u] - The man knows the identity of the boy, and the two have a chat room. Each night the man chooses one target player to kill. There is no kill on Night 0. When lynched, the man can take another player out with him.

[u]The boy (Evil Priest)[/u] - The boy knows the identity of the man, and the two have a chat room. The boy will learn the exact roles of the recently departed each night. The boy counts for parity. However, if only the boy remains, there will be no NK's. The boy is tough and will survive 1 death of any sort. 

[u]Ely (Sorcerer)[/u] - Each night receives a vision of a target player as 'seer' or 'not seer' (views the Roaster). Ely receives a vision on Night 0 of one randomly chosen player that is 'not seer.' Thereafter, Ely chooses which player to view.  Ely knows the identity of the man with the yellow parka. The sorcerer can kill another player when lynched or killed. Ely does not count for parity.

[u]The man with the yellow parka (Wolf Cub)[/u] - The man with the yellow parka knows the identity of the man and the boy.  When the man is lynched, the man with the yellow parka will be promoted to full wolf status.  He will gain access to wolfchat with the boy (if still alive) and the ability to NK. The man with the yellow parka counts for parity before promotion.


[b]Victory Conditions:[/b]

[u]Good[/u] - All good players win if the werewolf, evil priest, and wolf cub are eliminated, or if the last two players remaining are the hunter and one of the werewolf, wolf cub, or evil priest. The sorcerer does not have to be eliminated in order for Good to win.

[u]Evil[/u] - All evil players win if the werewolf, evil priest, and wolf cub achieve parity: if at any time their number equals the number of all other player remaining (including the sorcerer), evil wins. However, if one is left with the hunter, then good wins. The sorcerer counts as a good player for these purposes.


[b]Lynch Rules:[/b]

Each day players vote for one player to be lynched. The player receiving the most votes is killed. If there is a tie between two or more players, the tied player with the <tiebreaker> is killed and their side (good or evil) is revealed.

Lynch time is <lynch> BGG time. Votes cast with this time-stamp are counted. Votes cast after this time are invalid. Votes made during the night phase are invalid.

All votes must conform to the Cassandra Vote Tally System rules. (Will be
posted once the game starts).  If all living players [vote nightfall] it will
speed up the dusk.  


[b]Night Orders:[/b]

Wolves, Seer and Sorcerer must all submit their night orders by <night> BGG time. They do this by using the Cassandra Game Order system in the Cassandra Chat System.

The wolves' night kill choice is revealed with the DAWN post. The players' side is revealed as well. 

If all living players (including those with out night actions) click on the
'Lock Game Actions' button it will speed up Dawn.
