Revealing 13-Player Ruleset

[b]Good Roles:[/b]

[u]Seer[/u] - Each night receives a vision of a target player as 'wolf' or 'not wolf.'  The target is chosen by the player every night.

[u]9 Villagers[/u] - Ordinary villagers with no special powers.

[b]Evil Roles:[/b]

[u]3 Werewolves[/u] - The werewolves know each other's identity, and may private message/chat without restriction. Each night the wolves choose one target player to kill. There is no kill on Night 0.

[b]Victory Conditions:[/b]

[u]Good[/u] - All good players win if all werewolves are eliminated.

[u]Evil[/u] - All evil players win if the wolves achieve parity: if at any time the number of wolves remaining equals the number of non-wolves remaining, evil wins.

[b]Lynch Rules:[/b]

Each day players vote for one player to be lynched. The player receiving the most votes is killed. If there is a tie between two or more players, the tied player with the <tiebreaker> is killed.

Lynch time is <lynch> BGG time. Votes cast with this time-stamp are counted. Votes cast after this time are invalid. Votes made during the night phase are invalid.

All votes must conform to the Cassandra Vote Tally System rules. (Will be
posted once the game starts). If all living players vote night fall it will
speed up the dusk.

The player's role will be revealed upon lynch.


[b]Night Orders:[/b]

Wolves and Seer must all submit their night orders by <night> BGG time. They do this by using the Cassandra Game Order system in the Cassandra Chat System.

The wolves' night kill choice is revealed with the DAWN post. The players' role will also be revealed.

If all living players (including those with out night actions) click on the
'Lock Game Actions' button it will speed up Dawn.
