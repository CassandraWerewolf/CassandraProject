[u][b]The Roles:[/b][/u]

r{[b][u]Evil[/u][/b]}r

r{[b]1 Werewolf[/b]}r

The Werewolf may target one player to kill each night. The Werewolf counts for parity. The Werewolf receives a random view of one of the 3 Priests on N0, he will not learn the alignment of the Priest. The Werewolf is tough and will survive one lynch or nightkill attempt.

r{[b]2 Evil Priests[/b]}r

The Evil Priests may target one player each night to kill. This kill is in addition to the Werewolf's kill. The Evil Priests receive the full roles of deceased players each dawn. The Evil Priests share a chatroom together. 

r{[b]1 Sorcerer[/b]}r

The Sorcerer may target one player each night to view for seer/not seer. The Sorcerer receives a positive result when viewing either the Seer or the Aux Seer but he will not be able to distinguish between the two. The Sorcerer receives a random negative view on N0.

The Seer may target one player each night to view that player's full role. The Seer will receive a view of a random Villager on N0.
