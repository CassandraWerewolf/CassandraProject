Good: All good aligned players will win when the Werewolves and Wolf Cub are killed.

Evil: All evil aligned players will win when parity is reached. The Werewolves count towards parity. The Wolf Cub does not count towards parity unless promoted to full Werewolf.


[b][u]Lynch Rules:[/u][/b]

Each day players vote for one player to be lynched. The player receiving the most votes is killed. If there is a tie between two or more players, the tied player with the <tiebreaker> is killed.


[b][u]Deadlines:[/u][/b]

Dusk is at <lynch> BGG time. Votes cast with this time-stamp are counted. Votes cast after this time are invalid. Votes made during the night phase are invalid.

All votes must conform to the Cassandra Vote Tally System rules. (Will be posted once the game starts). If all living players vote nightfall it will speed up dusk.

Dawn is at <night> BGG time. All night actions must be submitted in the Cassandra Chat System before this time.

If all living players (including those without night actions) click on the 'Lock Game Actions' button it will speed up Dawn.  


[b][u]Other Rules:[/u][/b]

Do not post the content of your Mod Chat room to the game thread. You may summarize, but direct copying is not allowed. Consider that like showing your card to the group in a face-to-face game.
