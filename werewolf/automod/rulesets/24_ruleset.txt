Masters of Evil Ruleset

[b]Good Roles:[/b]

[u]Seer[/u] - Each night receives a vision of a target player and learns the players side (Good/Evil). The seer receives a vision on Night 0 of one randomly chosen player that is not Evil. Thereafter, the seer chooses which player to view.

[u]Hunter[/u] - There is a 50% chance that there is a hunter in the game.  If only two players remain in the game and the hunter is one of those players, then the good team wins even if the other player is a werewolf.  The hunter will be revealed as a villager on death.

[u]9 Villagers[/u] - Ordinary villagers with no special powers.  There is a 50% chance that there are 10 villagers.


[b]Evil Roles:[/b]

[u]2 Werewolves[/u] - The werewolves know each other's identity, and may private message/chat without restriction. Each night the wolves choose one target player to kill. There is no kill on Night 0.

[u]2 Wolfcubs[/u] - The wolfcubs will know the identity of the werewolves but not of eachother.  When a wolf dies a wolfcub will be promoted to full werewolf status.


[b]Victory Conditions:[/b]

[u]Good[/u] - All good players win if all werewolves are eliminated, or if the last two players remaining are the hunter and one werewolf. 

[u]Evil[/u] - All evil players win if the wolves and wolf cubs achieve parity: if at any time the number of wolves and wolf cubs remaining equals the number of non-wolves remaining, evil wins. Howver, if one wolf is left with the hunter, then good wins. 


[b]Lynch Rules:[/b]

Each day players vote for one player to be lynched. The player receiving the most votes is killed. If there is a tie between two or more players, the tied player with the <tiebreaker> is killed.

Lynch time is <lynch> BGG time. Votes cast with this time-stamp are counted. Votes cast after this time are invalid. Votes made during the night phase are invalid.

All votes must conform to the Cassandra Vote Tally System rules. (Will be
posted once the game starts). If all living players vote night fall it will
speed up the dusk.

If the player is a wolf or wolf cub they will be revealed as Lupis Family upon death.  The Seer will be revealed as seer upon death.  The Hunter and villagers will be revealed as villager upon death.


[b]Night Orders:[/b]

Wolves and Seer must all submit their night orders by <night> BGG time. They do this by using the Cassandra Game Order system in the Cassandra Chat System.

The wolves' night kill choice is revealed with the DAWN post. If the player is a wolf or wolf cub they will be revealed as Lupis Family upon death.  The Seer will be revealed as seer upon death.  The Hunter and villagers will be revealed as villager upon death.

If all living players (including those with out night actions) click on the
'Lock Game Actions' button it will speed up Dawn.
