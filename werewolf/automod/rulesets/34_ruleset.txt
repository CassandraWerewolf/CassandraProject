[size=12][b]Village of the seers[/b][/size]

This is 13 player game.

There will be 2 teams, good and evil.

Good wins when both of the wolves are dead.
Evil wins when the wolves achieve parity with the remaining players. (see hunter rules for the one exception)

g{[b][u]Team Good[/u][/b]}g

[b]2 Hunters:[/b] If a hunter is left alone with a wolf, good will win instead of evil. Hunters may a view a player, living or dead, each night. The other hunter will be seen as "hunter". Any other player will be viewed as "unable to determine role". 

[b]6 seers:[/b] view a player each night, including N0 to see if they are a wolf or not. There are 6 types of seers, and one of each is in the game.

-True Seer: Gets correct results
-Insane seer: gets incorrect results
-Paranoid seer: always gets 'wolf' except when viewing the tinker/hunter
-Niave seer: always gets 'not wolf', except when viewing the tinker/hunter.
-Drunken Seer: gets 'wolf' when viewing a sorcerer, wolf cub, or hunter.
-Unstable seer: gets 'wolf' when viewing a seer.

Seer types are not known to player, but are revealed on death.

r{[b][u]Team Evil[/u][/b]}r

[b]2 Wolves:[/b] Know and can chat with each other, and kill one player each night. On N0, each wolf learn a random player that is "not evil." Note that the hunter/tinker is excluded from this view.

[b]1 Wolf Cub:[/b] Knows the IDs of the wolves. Revealed on death as a random kind of seer, sorcerer, or hunter. When one of the wolves dies, joins wolf chat and counts for parity.  

[b]2 Sorcerers:[/b] Each night, including N0, view a player to see if they are a seer. There are 2 types of sorcerers, and one of each is in the game:

-Cunning Sorcerer: Always gets correct results
-Insane sorcerer: Always gets incorrect results

Sorcerer types are not known to player, but are revealed on death.
Sorcerers have a chat room, [u]but may not view themselves or each other.[/u]

[b]Seers and sorcerers cannot view themselves. Cassandra cannot enforce this, so it's on the honor system.

It is against the spirit of the rules to discuss or coordinate N0 views.

Other then that, it's standard rules.[/b]

Dalestephenson came up with the idea for village of the seers games. Avin and Lardarse expanded on his ideas, and redhawke put this template into automod format.
