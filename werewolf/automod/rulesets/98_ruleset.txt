b{Not so long ago (but not very recently either) in a land not too far away (but not too close either) there was a town. People you stick six feet under don't want to stay down in those parts, and have taken to walking around as zombies. Naturally, this place was known as GHOST TOWN.

But a grave threat has arrisen to ghost town- werewolves. They care not for the dead, but are surely the gravest threat any of the living have ever known. 

Look out people. This time, the dead are fighting back.}b

[b]Evil roles (total 3, for those who can't add)[/b]

[u]2 Wolves[/u]- Chat with each other and kill someone each night. 

[u]1 Sorcerer[/u]- views a player each to see if they are a seer or not. Random negative N0 view.

[b]Good roles (total 6, again for those who can't add)[/b]

[u]1 seer[/u]- views a player each to see if they are a wolf or not. Random negative N0 view.

[u]5 Villagers[/u]- Try to vote out wolves and die vialently in the night.

Do I really need to explain all that? Is there seriously a werewolfer here who doesn't know what those roles are? Besides, I hate typing all that out.

[b]Lynch rules[/b]

Each day the person who ends the day with the most votes in lynched. A lynched person is dead. How to vote is explained in a post cassy will make when the game starts. Lynch time is <lynch>. Tiebreaker is <tiebreaker>. 

I'm sure there will be someone to explain it to you if you're confused about it. 

[b]Night rules[/b]

Night orders are due by <night>. The seer and sorcerer get a view every night, and the wolves get to kill someone each night. A killed person is dead. [-]Don't post night view info before dawn. (that means YOU, seer and sorcerers.[/-] Actually, that rule is usually in place because people don't want dead seers sharing thier last view. I don't think that will matter here, personally...  

[b]Death and consequences[/b]

People who are lynched or nightkilled are dead.
Dead people do not count for parity.
Dead people cannot vote.
Dead seers and sorcerer cannot view players, and dead wolves cannot kill.
Roles are not revealed on death.  

However, unlike most games, the dead may continue to post freely. Dead wolves can continue to contribute to wolf chat. The only rule is that they must bracket any posts with :zombie: s. 

Example:

[q="example"] :zombie: example :zombie: [/q]

Other than that, the dead can post all they want. Hope you don't mind zombies. They're pretty common here in GHOST TOWN. 

[b]Victory conditions[/b]

Evil wins when the wolves have parity with non-wolves.
Good wins when both wolves are dead. 

I repeat my belief that saying that stuff isn't nessasary. Can we just say that standard bgg werewolf rules apply except where listed?
