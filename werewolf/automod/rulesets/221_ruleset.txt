[b]Basics:[/b]

This is a straightforward game including most of the roles commonly used in BGG Werewolf.

Each day the players vote to lynch somebody.  Whoever gets the most votes will be killed.

There then follows a short night period.  During the night the wolves choose one target to kill by entering orders in Cassandra, and other special roles will also enter orders.

Good wins if both wolves are killed.  Evil wins if the number of wolves equals the number of non-wolves.  Also see the Hunter role below.

Werewolves are also known as 'max evils' or 'maxes'.  Non-werewolf evil roles are also known as 'aux evils' or 'auxes'.

[b]Evil Roles:[/b]

Two Werewolves.  Share a chat and jointly control the night-kill.

One Sorcerer.  Views for seers, gets a hit on the Seer and the Aux Seer.  Starts with a random non-seer view.

One Cultist.  Starts the game knowing who the wolves are.
